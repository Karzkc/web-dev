        A synchronous nature of js
    </h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes code in a single sequential flow. This means that only one
        piece of code can be executed at a time, preventing concurrent execution.
        <br>
        This makes the execution of JavaScript code blocking, meaning that the execution of one script will halt until
        the other script has finished.
        <br>
        This can lead to performance issues, as it makes the browser unresponsive during script execution.
        <br>
        For example, consider the following code:
        <br>
        <code>
            for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
                console.log(i);
            }
        </code>
        <br>
        In this code, the loop will take a long time to complete, making the browser unresponsive until it finishes.
        <br>
        To improve performance, asynchronous programming techniques can be used, such as callbacks, promises, or
        async/await
    </p>
    <p>
        for eg in script js when we use set timeout the js will execute everything but set time on last to save time and
        memory , even if time is set 0 still it will be loaded at last due to asynchronous nature of js
    </p>
    <p>
        console log was synchronous so it was executed firstly unlike set timeout
