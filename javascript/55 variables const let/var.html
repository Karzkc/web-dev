    <p>
        definition -
        A variable is a named location in memory used to store data. It has a specific type and can be changed
        throughout the program.
        syntax -
        let variableName: data type = value;
    </p>
    <h2>
        var
    </h2>
    <p>
        var is function-scoped. It can be reassigned and redeclared within the same function.
        syntax -
        var variableName = value;
    </p>
    <h2>
        let
    </h2>
    <p>
        let is block-scoped. It cannot be reassigned and redeclared within the same block (i.e., a pair of curly braces
        {}).
        syntax -
        let variableName = value;
    </p>
    <h2>
        const
    </h2>
    <p>
        const is block-scoped. It cannot be reassigned and redeclared within the same block. It can be used to declare a
        constant value that cannot be changed.
        syntax -
        const variableName = value;
    </p>
    <h2>
        typeof
    </h2>
    <p>
        typeof operator returns the type of a variable.
        syntax -
        typeof variableName;
    </p>
    <h2>
        rules and what kind of variable names are allowed or not
    </h2>
    <p>
        - Variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). <br>
        - Variable names can contain letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($). <br>
        - Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVariable and myvariable are different variables). <br>
        - Variable names cannot be reserved keywords (e.g., let, var, const, class, etc.). <br>
        - Variable names cannot start with a number. <br>
        - Variable names cannot contain any spaces. <br>
        - Variable names cannot contain any special characters other than underscore (_). <br>
        - Variable names should be meaningful and easy to understand. <br>
        - Variable names should not contain any consecutive underscores (_). <br>
        example -
        let myVariable = "Hello World!";
        const PI = 3.14;
        let _underscore_variable = "Hello World!";
        let $dollar_variable = "Hello World!";
        let my_variable = "Hello World!"; // not allowed because it contains spaces
        let my-variable = "Hello World!"; // not allowed because it contains a hyphen
        let let = "Hello World!"; // not allowed because it is a reserved keyword
    </p>
    <h2>
        difference bw let var and const
    </h2>
    <p>
        - let is block-scoped and can be reassigned and redeclared within the same block. <br>
        - var is function-scoped and can be reassigned and redeclared within the same function. <br>
        - const is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned. It can be used to declare a constant value that cannot be
        changed. <br>
        example -
        let x = 10;
        {
        let x = 20;
        console.log(x); // Output: 20
        }
        console.log(x); // Output: 10
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        let x = 10;
        console.log(x);// This will print 10 to the console.
        {
        let x = 20;
        console.log(x); // This will print 20 to the console.
        //this is beacuse of block scope in JavaScript
        }

    <h2>
        Data Types & Objects
    </h2>
    <p>
        - JavaScript supports different data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, bigint,
        and object. <br>
        - Objects are used to store data and behavior in JavaScript. Objects are created using object literals or by
        using the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function. <br>
        example -
       <pre>
        let myNumber = 10;
        let myString = "Hello World!";
        let myBoolean = true;
        let myNull = null;
        let myUndefined = undefined;
        let mySymbol = Symbol("mySymbol");
        let myBigInt = 10000000000000000000n;
        let myObject = {
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 30
        };
       </pre>
       null is considered as object 
        example -
        let myNullObject = null;
    </p>
    <h2>
        object 
    </h2>
    <p>
        - Objects are used to store data and behavior in JavaScript. Objects are created using object literals or by using the `new` keyword followed by the constructor function. <br>
        - Object properties are key-value pairs separated by commas. <br>
        - Object properties can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., obj.property) or square bracket notation (e.g., obj["property"]). <br>
        - Objects can have methods, which are functions defined inside an object. <br>
        - Objects can be nested within other objects. <br>
        example -
        <pre>
        let person = {
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 30,
        address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "New York",
        country: "USA"
        },
        getAgeInYears: function() {
        return this.age;
        }
        };
        </pre>
        person.getAge
