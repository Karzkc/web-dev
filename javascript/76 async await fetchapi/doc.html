    <h1>Understanding Asynchronous JavaScript, Async/Await, and Fetch API</h1>

    <h2>1. Asynchronous Nature of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript executes code in a single thread, meaning one thing happens at a time. When you run a long task, it can
        block the execution of other tasks, making the page unresponsive. However, with asynchronous functions, JavaScript
        can perform tasks like fetching data from a server without stopping the entire flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's an example showing the async nature of JavaScript:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
console.log("1st task - Synchronous code starts");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("3rd task - Asynchronous code executed after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("2nd task - Synchronous code continues immediately");
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>2. What is an Async Function?</h2>
    <p>
        An <code>async</code> function in JavaScript is a special type of function that allows asynchronous code to be written
        in a cleaner way. With an async function, you can pause the execution of code using the <code>await</code> keyword and wait
        for asynchronous tasks to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of an <code>async</code> function:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
async function fetchData() {
    console.log("Fetching data...");
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log("Data received:", data);
}
fetchData();
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In the above code, the function pauses at the <code>await</code> line until the data is fetched. The execution continues
        only after the data has been received.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What is <code>await</code>?</h2>
    <p>
        The <code>await</code> keyword is used inside an async function to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved.
        It makes sure the code after it runs only when the awaited Promise has finished.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we remove <code>await</code>, the Promise would remain in the "pending" state, and the subsequent code would run before the 
        asynchronous task finishes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Fetch API</h2>
    <p>
        The Fetch API is used to make HTTP requests in JavaScript, which are asynchronous by nature. You can use fetch to get or send data
        to a server. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the completion of the request.
    </p>

    <h3>4.1 Fetch API - GET Request</h3>
    <p>
        A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. Here's an example using the Fetch API to fetch data:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
async function getData() {
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log("GET request data:", data);
}
getData();
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        This fetches data from a placeholder API (JSONPlaceholder), and <code>await</code> ensures the data is retrieved before logging it.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Fetch API - POST Request</h3>
    <p>
        A POST request is used to send data to the server. This can be useful when submitting form data or sending data in JSON format.
        Here's an example of a POST request:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
async function postData() {
    let response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
            title: 'foo',
            body: 'bar',
            userId: 1,
        }),
        headers: {
            'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
        },
    });
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log("POST request response:", data);
}
postData();
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we send some JSON data to the server using the POST method, and the server responds with the newly created data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Differences between GET and POST Requests</h2>
    <p>
        <b>GET Request</b>: Retrieves data from the server. It's mainly used to access resources and doesn't alter data on the server.
        <br><b>POST Request</b>: Sends data to the server, often used to submit forms or upload data. It can modify the server's data.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Data:</h3>
    <pre>
<code>
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Asynchronous programming in JavaScript using async functions, await, and the Fetch API provides a more efficient way to
        handle tasks like fetching data from a server. Understanding the difference between GET and POST requests is key when 
        working with APIs.
