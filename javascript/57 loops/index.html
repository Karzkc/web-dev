    <h1>
        Javascript loops
    </h1>
    <p>
        loops -
        loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. They are essential for performing tasks repeatedly, such
        as iterating through arrays, counting, or performing calculations. <br>
        JavaScript has three types of loops: for, while, and do-while.
    </p> <br>
    <h2>
        for loop
    </h2>
    <p>
        for loop is used to - 
        iterate through a specified number of times. <br>
        in for loop there are three types: for , for in , for of 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>for loop -
            syntax -
            for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
                statement(s);
            }
        </li> <br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    console.log('Number is'+ i);
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <li>for in loop -
            syntax -
            for (variable in object) {
                statement(s);
            }
        </li> <br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                var arr = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
                for (var i in arr) {
                    console.log(arr[i]);
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <li>for of loop -
            syntax -
            for (variable of iterable) {
                statement(s);
            }
        </li> <br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                var fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
                for (var fruit of fruits) {
                    console.log(fruit);
                }
                

            </code>
        </pre>
    </ul>
    <p>
        difference betweeen these 3 - <br>
        for loop - used when you know exactly how many times you want to iterate <br>
        for in loop - used when you want to iterate through the properties of an object <br>
        for of loop - used when you want to iterate through the values of an iterable object (such as an array or string) <br>
        Note: for of loop is more efficient than for in loop when you need to iterate through the values of an array or string.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>
        while loop
    </h2>
    <p>
        while loop is used to -
        execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. <br>
        syntax -
        while (condition) {
            statement(s);
        }
    </p> <br>
    <pre>
        <code>
            var i = 0;
            while (i < 5) {
                console.log('Number is'+ i);
                i++;
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>
        difference between while loop and for loop - <br>
        while loop - used when you don't know exactly how many times you want to iterate <br>
        for loop - used when you know exactly how many times you want to iterate <br>
        Note: while loop is more flexible and easier to use when you don't know the exact number of iterations.
    </p> <br>
    <h2>
        do-while loop
    </h2>
    <p>
        do-while loop is used to -
        execute a block of code once, and then repeatedly execute the block as long as a specified condition is true. <br>
        syntax -
        do {
            statement(s);
        } while (condition);
    </p>
    <br>
    <pre>
        <code>
            var i = 0;
            do {
                console.log('Number is'+ i);
                i++;
            } while (i < 5);
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        difference between do-while loop and while loop - <br>
        do-while loop - used when you want to execute the block at least once <br>
        while loop - used when you don't want to execute the block at least once <br>
        Note: do-while loop is more flexible and easier to use when you want to execute the block at least once. <br>
        Also nowadays do-while loop is not used as 
         most developers prefer to use for, while, or for of loops.
