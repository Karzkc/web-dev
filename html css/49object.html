    <h1>
        object fit
    </h1>
    <p>
        Object-fit allows you to scale images to fit a specified element's box without distorting the aspect ratio. It
        can be used to maintain the aspect ratio of images while ensuring that they fit within the container without
        cropping. <br>
        suppose if we give h and w to a container or image its aspect ratio messes up then we can use object fit cover
        to
    </p>
    <h2>
        object fit - cover
    </h2>
    <p>
        This property will scale the image to the largest size that will fit both its width and height within the
        container's
        dimensions, while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be centered within the container, and any parts
        of it that
        extend beyond the container's boundaries will be clipped. <br>

    </p>

    <h2>
        object-fit - contain
    </h2>
    <p>
        This property will scale the image to the smallest size that will fit both its width and height within the
        container's
        dimensions, while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be centered within the container, and any parts
        of it that
        extend beyond the container's boundaries will be clipped. <br>

        Note: As the aspect ratio of the image changes, the size of the container changes, and the image will be scaled
        accordingly.

    <h2>
        object-fit - fill
    </h2>
    <p>
        This property will scale the image to the largest size that will fit both its width and height within the
        container's
        dimensions, while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be positioned at the top left corner of the
        container,
        and any parts of it that extend beyond the container's boundaries will be clipped. <br>

    <h2>
        object-position
    </h2>
    <p>
        object-position allows you to control the position of the object within its container. You can specify the
        horizontal and vertical
        alignment of the object using percentage values, as well as using keywords like "center". <br>
        For example, object-position: 50% 50% will center the object horizontally and vertically within its container.
        <br>
        You can also specify multiple values, separated by spaces, to position the object along both axes. For example,
        object-position: 50% 50% 10% will position the object 10% from the top and left edges of its container.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
        <img src="mi.jpeg" alt="pic" class="first">
    </div>
    <p>
        object-position: top right; means that -
        the top edge of the image will be aligned with the top edge of the container, and the right edge of the image
        will be aligned with the right edge of the container.
        <br>
        object-position: center; means that -
        the image will be centered both horizontally and vertically within its container.
        <br>
        object-position: 50% 50% 10% will position the image 10% from the top and left edges of its container. <br>
        object-position: 10px 20px will 
        position the image 10px from the top and 20px from the left edges of its container.

    <h2>
        object-fit - scale down
    </h2>
    <p>
        This property will scale the image to the largest size that will fit both its width and height within the
        container's
        dimensions, while maintaining its aspect ratio. The image will be positioned at the top left corner of the
        container,
        and any parts of it that extend beyond the container's boundaries will be clipped. <br>
        object-fit: scale-down; will scale the image down to fit the container while maintaining its aspect ratio. If
        the image
        is larger than the container, it will be centered within the container and any parts that extend beyond the
        container's
        boundaries will be clipped.
    </p>
    <div class="box">
        <img src="mi.jpeg" alt="pic" class="fourth">
    </div>
    <h2>
        onject fit - none
    </h2>
    <p>
        This property will not scale the image. Instead, it will maintain its original size and position within the
        container. <br>
        object-fit: none; will not scale the image.

    <h1>
        background image and properties 
    </h1>
    <p>
        The background-image property allows you to set an image as the background for an element. You can specify
        multiple
        background images using the background-image property, separated by commas. <br>
        The background-position property allows you to control the position of the background image within the element.
        You can specify
        the horizontal and vertical alignment of the background image using percentage values, as well as using
        keywords like
        "center". <br>
        For example, background-position: 50% 50% will center the background image horizontally and vertically within
        the element.
        <br>
        You can also specify multiple values, separated by spaces, to position the background image along both axes. For
        example, background-position: 50% 50% 10% will position the background image 10% from the top and left edges
        of the element.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>
        background - position 

    </h2>
    <p>
        background-position: top right; means that -
        the top edge of the background image will be aligned with the top edge of the element, and the right edge of the
        background image will be aligned with the right edge of the element.
        <br>
        background-position: center; means that -
        the background image will be centered both horizontally and vertically within the element.
        <br>
        background-position: 50% 50% 10% will position the background image 10% from the top and left edges of the element. <br>
        background-position: 10px 20px will position the background image 10px from the top and 20px from the left edges of
        the element.

    <div class="box1">
        
    </div> <hr>
    <h2>
        background repeat 
    </h2>
    <p>
        background-repeat allows you to control whether the background image repeats in both horizontal and vertical directions.
        You can specify
        the following values for background-repeat:
        <ul>
            <li>no-repeat - The background image will not repeat.</li>
            <li>repeat - The background image will repeat both horizontally and vertically.</li>
            <li>repeat-x - The background image will repeat horizontally, but not vertically.</li>
            <li>repeat-y - The background image will repeat vertically, but not horizontally.</li>
            <li>space - The background image will repeat with space between tiles.</li>
            <li>round - The background image will repeat with rounding between tiles.</li>
        </ul>
        

        
        

    </p> <hr>
    <h2>
        background clip - 
    </h2>
    <p>
        background-clip allows you to control the area of the background that is visible. You can specify
        the following values for background-clip:
        <ul>
            <li>border-box - The background is clipped to the border box of the element.</li>
            <li>padding-box - The background is clipped to the padding box of the element.</li>
            <li>content-box - The background is clipped to the content box of the element.</li>
            <li>text - The background is clipped to the text content of the element.</li>
        </ul>
